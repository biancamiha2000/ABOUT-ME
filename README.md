  I am a student at the Faculty of "Applied Sciences" specialized in Mathematics and Computer Science within the UPB.
  I just finished a Web Developing & Testing internship at @Capgemini where I learned how to built a dynamic website using React.js, HTML, JavaScript and other external libraries and how to automate functional testing cases to search for bugs or errors using Tricentis Tosca and Selenium WebDriver.
  I am looking forward to new opportunities as I am actively looking for new projects
